## General Info
Explore my front-end programming skills showcased in this React project, a testament to my dedication to mastering the art and science of creating captivating user interfaces. Crafted through meticulous learning and hands-on experience, this site represents not only my technical proficiency but also a harmonious blend of design aesthetics and functional excellence.

Each component reflects my commitment to staying current with industry best practices, from responsive design principles to the seamless integration of cutting-edge technologies. I invite you to explore various sections, each highlighting a facet of my capabilities as a front-end developer.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy navigating through the culmination of my programming journey!

## Technologies
This project incorporates a variety of technologies and tools, including but not limited to:
- JSX (JavaScript XML) 
- Flexbox 
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript ES6+ Features
- React.js
- Create React App (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, PostCSS, CSS Loader & Style Loader)
- Styled components (utilization of syntax with template literals)
- Media Queries
- Immutability with the immer library in Redux (for state management)
- Custom Hooks
- Local Storage with Redux-Saga
- Redux (utilizing actions, reducers, and middleware for asynchronous operations) 
- JavaScript generator functions (pause and resume functions), providing a mechanism for powerful asynchronous programming
- Axios
- Async/Await
- API Integration

## Status
This project reflects my recent journey into front-end development, showcasing skills acquired over the past few months.

## Inspiration
This website is inspired by the course "Frontend Developer from the Basics" by the online programming school YouCode.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
